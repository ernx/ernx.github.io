<h1>About Cortex</h1>
<p>
We recognize that there is a challenge with knowledge sharing in a distributed organization.  The Cortex bot is a Slack app that provides a quick method of sharing messages from within Slack and storing them to a designated target location, such as a Confluence page.  
</p>

<a name="usage"></a>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Install the Cortex app from the Slack app directory.  If you don't have permissions to do so, seek assistance from your workspace admin.
</p>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>
<p>
Select the 3 vertical dots on a Slack message to open the actions menu.  If you don’t see Cortex’s “Share Story” action, you may need to select “More message actions…” to find it from the available actions, as only your most used actions will appear in the context menu.
</p>
<p>
After selecting the “Share Story” message action, you will be presented with a modal dialog allowing you to enter a tagline, modify the message to be shared, and select a category.
</p>
<p>
Then press “Share” and the message will be automatically submitted to a register of stories on a designated Confluence page.
</p>

<h2>Alternative usage</h2>
<p>
Alternatively, you may trigger the “Share Story” screen in Slack by using a slash command as a starting point.  Start a new message in Slack with the text /share and press enter.  The Cortex Share Story screen should appear.

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Last Modified: January 11th, 2020</h3>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>
Thank you for using Cortex. We care about how your information is treated, so we’ve created this Privacy Policy (sometimes referred to as the “Policy”), which focuses on how we collect personally identifiable (or “personal”) information. Personal information identifies or describes a particular individual, such as a person’s first and last name, email address, physical address or telephone number.
</p>
<p>
This Policy applies to our websites, services, products, and applications (each a “Service”) and explains the following:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>What information we gather from you when you use the Service</li>
<li>How we may use and share this information</li>
<li>The security approaches we use to protect your information</li>
<li>We will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page and revise the “last modified” date on the Policy. Your access to and use of this Service is also subject to your acceptance of these Terms of Service.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
<p>
We collect only the <b>minimum personal information necessary to operate</b>, maintain and provide you the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable laws. “Content” refers to information, messages, text and other data which is collected, stored, surfaced, and shared through the use of our Service.
</p>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>
When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information sent by your client. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, client type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information.
</p>
<h2>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests</h2>
<p>
We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.
</p>
<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>
We’ve adopted commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We guard against common web attack vectors, host data in secure SOC 1, SOC 2, ISO 27001 and ISO 9001 compliant data center facilities, and implement industry standard firewalls and access restrictions on our servers to secure our network. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however, and we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit or store in the Service.
</p>
<p>
In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a security breach, we will promptly notify the affected parties in accordance with our notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
</p>
<h2>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<p>
We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
</p>
<p>
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, as well as the GPDR, we will process data subject requests (as directed by the customer or “data controller”) and resolve complaints about our collection or use of personal information.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>
<p>
We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies.
</p>
<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
